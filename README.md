1. Title:
Smart Wearable Pregnancy Monitoring Belt for Contraction and Maternal Health Monitoring
2. Objective:
To develop a wearable belt that continuously monitors maternal contractions and vital health parameters to support early detection of labour risks and promote safer pregnancy care.
3. Abstract:
This project proposes a smart wearable pregnancy monitoring belt designed to assist in identifying labour-related risks through continuous monitoring of maternal physiological activity. The system uses an ADXL345 accelerometer to measure abdominal contraction intensity and classify it into four states: Normal, Low, Mild, and High. A MAX30102 optical sensor is integrated to estimate heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO₂), providing insight into maternal health and stress levels. Whenever contraction intensity reaches a critical range, the system activates an alarm through a buzzer to notify the user. Real-time values and status updates are displayed on a digital display. Additionally, the system dynamically adjusts the Expected Delivery Date (EDD) when repeated high-intensity contractions are detected, enabling proactive decision-making and timely medical consultation. This prototype is designed as a low-cost, non-invasive wearable device suitable for continuous home-based monitoring. By offering early awareness and timely alerts, the system aims to improve maternal safety, support healthcare accessibility, and reduce pregnancy-related complications during late-term pregnancy.
